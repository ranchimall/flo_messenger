# FLO Messenger
 
• Messenger is a blockchain-based decentralized messaging app that uses Bitcoin or FLO blockchain addresses as user identities. Instead of a centralized server, messages are encrypted and stored in the users' browsers.  
• Bitcoin or FLO blockchain addresses can communicate with each other using a messaging interface  
• Messenger comes with "Multisig" where users can create multi-sig addresses and using a messaging interface make transactions on the multi-sig.  
• Switching browsers or devices won't bring back old messages. Remember to back up and import to access your messages in the new browser/device. That's the security of Messenger.  

#### Note:  
Do not lose the private key. Copy and save it securely. Once a private key is lost, it cannot be recovered
